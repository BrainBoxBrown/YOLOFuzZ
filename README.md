# YOLOFuzZ
I had an idea and I've decided to seriously work on it in my spare time. https://pastebinthehacker.blogspot.com.au/2016/09/yolofuzz.html

Idea: A fuzzer that flips jmp instructions

Why?
Instead of working really hard to find input that covers the code base, just force it to get run.

Won't that just crash shit constantly?
Probably.
I'm hoping I can triage crashes and progress in a way that makes it useful.
Later plans include automagic analysis.



Goals/Milestones/Plans:

Plan the architechure. Try some ideas. fuck shit up

the rest

# I should change this things name to box basher


K so we have the user interaction bit, replay fuzz shit and analysis
